## fd
https://github.com/sharkdp/fd/

fd is a program to find entries in your filesystem. It is a simple, fast and user-friendly alternative to find. While it does not aim to support all of find's powerful functionality, it provides sensible (opinionated) defaults for a majority of use cases.

```bash
sudo apt install fd-find
```
Note that the binary is called **fdfind** as the binary name fd is already used by another package. It is recommended that after installation, you add a link to fd by executing command ```ln -s $(which fdfind) ~/.local/bin/fd```

## jq
https://github.com/stedolan/jq

jq is like sed for JSON data - you can use it to slice and filter and map and transform structured data with the same ease that sed, awk, grep and friends let you play with text.

```bash
sudo apt install jq
```

## bat
https://github.com/sharkdp/bat

bat supports syntax highlighting for a large number of programming and markup languages.  

bat communicates with git to show modifications with respect to the index (see left side bar):

```bash
sudo apt install bat
```
Important: If you install bat this way, please note that the executable may be installed as **batcat** instead of bat (due to a name clash with another package). You can set up a bat -> batcat symlink or alias to prevent any issues that may come up because of this and to be consistent with other distributions:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
ln -s /usr/bin/batcat ~/.local/bin/bat
```

## fff
https://github.com/dylanaraps/fff

A simple file manager written in bash.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dylanaraps/fff
cd fff
make install
```
### CD on Exit
To enable CD on Exit in Bash or Zsh, add this to your .bashrc, .zshrc or equivalent.  
Run 'fff' with 'f' or whatever you decide to name the function.
```bash
f() {
fff "$@"
cd "$(cat "${XDG_CACHE_HOME:=${HOME}/.cache}/fff/.fff_d")"
}
```

## duf
https://github.com/muesli/duf

Disk Usage/Free Utility (Linux, BSD, macOS & Windows)
